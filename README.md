# Sales Forecasting Forecasting using ARIMA Model in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of the **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** model to forecast sales trends using time series data and is built in Python.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Proficiency in time series analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Statsmodels.
- Expertise in identifying patterns such as trends and seasonality in data.
- Skills in evaluating and tuning statistical models for optimal performance.
- Clear communication of technical findings.
- Development of scalable, reproducible solutions in Python.

It’s a great example of my analytical mindset and passion for leveraging data to uncover actionable insights—skills I’m excited to bring to a data science or machine learning role!
